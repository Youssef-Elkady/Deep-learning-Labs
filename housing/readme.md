# Task

The task was to create a linear regression model using pytorch to predit the price of the house given its features      
The categorical features were first changed to dummy variables.  
The dataset was cleaned from duplicates and normalized using MINMAX normalization before starting training and validation using Pytorch   
These were the training results 
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1725820698624.0000    
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 957018.1250   
R-squared Score: 0.6586
