# Task

The task was to create a polynomial regression model using KERAS to predit the Y position depending on the time given   
The dataset was cleaned from duplicates and normalized using MINMAX normalization before starting training and validation using KERAS   
These were the training results 
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0330   
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.1384    
R-squared Score: 1.0000

## Dependecies

No dependcies needed as google collab has all the needed libraries pre installed.
