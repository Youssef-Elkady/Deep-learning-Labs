# Task
     
### Objective:
The goal is to build a binary classification model using a with Keras to predict heart disease based on health indicators from the provided dataset.      
      
### Dataset:     
The dataset contains 22 columns, with HeartDiseaseorAttack as the target variable. It consists of various health indicators, including HighBP, BMI, Smoker, Diabetes, etc.     
### Below is the residuals plot      

### Tuner    

The code is tuned using Keras Tuner to get the best hyperparameters for the best accuracy.
