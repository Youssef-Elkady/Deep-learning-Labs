# Task

### Objective:     
The goal is to build a multiclass classification model using PyTorch to classify Iris species based on various features from the Iris dataset.    
    
### Dataset (attached):      
   
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and one target variable (species). The species can be one of three classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica
